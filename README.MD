# ✅ TODO: CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices

This document captures critical tasks to enhance security, reliability, and maintainability of the deployment pipeline.

---

## 🛠️ **Pipeline Enhancements**

- [ ] **Run application tests (unit/integration)**  
      _before_ deploying Docker containers and infrastructure.

- [ ] Add **container security scanning**  
      (_e.g., Trivy or Snyk_) before pushing Docker images to Azure Container Registry.

- [ ] Implement **Terraform security scanning**  
      (_Checkov or Tfsec_) before applying infrastructure changes.

- [ ] Set up automated **Terraform state backups**.

---

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

- [ ] Write clear **integration tests** to validate database connectivity, migrations, and CRUD operations.

- [ ] Add automated **smoke tests** after deployment to validate endpoints and application health checks.

- [ ] Ensure tests run in the pipeline **before infrastructure deployment**  
      (_“Test before Deploy” principle_).

---

## 🚨 **Security Best Practices**

- [ ] Rotate Azure Service Principal credentials periodically (every 3-6 months).

- [ ] Implement secure management of Terraform state (use Terraform Cloud, Azure Blob Storage with RBAC, etc.).

- [ ] Implement managed identity and reduce usage of static credentials where possible.

- [ ] Regularly review and minimize permissions granted to GitHub Actions.

---

## 📈 **Monitoring & Observability**

- [ ] Integrate Azure App Insights or Prometheus/Grafana for proactive monitoring.

- [ ] Set up alerts on key infrastructure and application metrics (availability, errors, latency).

---

## 📖 **Documentation**

- [ ] Document CI/CD pipeline clearly, including secrets management and disaster recovery process.

- [ ] Regularly review and update infrastructure documentation as the system evolves.

---

## 🗓️ **Regular Reviews**

- [ ] Schedule quarterly reviews of CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure to adapt best practices.
